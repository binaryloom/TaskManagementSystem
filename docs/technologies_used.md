# Technologies Used

The Task Management System utilizes the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for backend development. Django provides a clean and pragmatic design for building web applications rapidly.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. DRF is used to create RESTful API endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Vue.js (Future)**: A progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. While the current frontend is built with Django templates and Jinja, there are plans to migrate to Vue.js for improved interactivity and user experience.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database management system used as the preferred choice for the underlying database. PostgreSQL offers robustness, scalability, and extensive features for data storage and retrieval.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the frontend components. Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with pre-designed utility classes.
- **VSCode**: A popular source-code editor developed by Microsoft. VSCode is used for writing, editing, and debugging code, providing a rich set of features and extensions for developers.
- **GitHub**: A web-based version control system and repository hosting service used for storing code, managing changes, and facilitating collaboration among developers.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into lightweight containers, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD platform provided by GitHub used for automating the build, test, and deployment processes. GitHub Actions are utilized for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment of the application.
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**: A container image registry service provided by GitHub used for storing Docker images. GHCR serves as a centralized location for version-controlled Docker images, facilitating containerized deployments.
- **PostgreSQL for Documentation**: PostgreSQL database is used for storing documentation-related data.
- **Sphinx**: A documentation generation tool used to create intelligent and beautiful documentation for Python projects. Sphinx generates documentation from reStructuredText files.
- **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language used for writing documentation files. Markdown is simple to write and easy to read, providing a convenient format for documenting project details.
